I've worked with an Ecommerce consumer behavior dataset of 2023  containing information such as order ID, user ID, product ID, product name, and more. Using this dataset, I've created two insightful bar graphs.

The first bar graph displays the frequency of product sales, indicating which products were sold the most. By analyzing this graph, you can identify the top-selling products, providing valuable insights into consumer preferences and popular items.

The second bar graph depicts the count of reorders, differentiating between products that were reordered (indicated by 1) and those that were not (indicated by 0). This graph offers insights into consumer behavior regarding repurchasing habits. Understanding which products are frequently reordered can inform marketing strategies and inventory management decisions.
